Part 1: Write your message here from GitHub
Hello World!

Task 1: 
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does
The "git fetch" command copies changes from your remote repository into your local repository without changing your working directory. This is what separates "git fetch" from "git pull". "git pull" copies changes from your remote repo to both your local repo and your working directory.  

Task 2:
// Under this line, describe the difference between Git and GitHub
Git is a version control system and Github hosts git repositories. Git is the technology that Github uses to host such repositories.
